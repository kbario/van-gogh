# Van Gogh

A meta-framework for [VanJS](https://vanjs.org/) that aims to offer a ergonomic developer experience with file-based routing, server actions and preconfigured rendering options like SSR and CSR for VanJS development.

It is built on top of [Vinxi](https://github.com/nksaraf/vinxi/) and [van_cone](https://github.com/vanjs-org/van/tree/main/addons/van_cone) to mimic the solid meta-framework [start start](https://github.com/solidjs/solid-start/). 

very much still a work in progress
